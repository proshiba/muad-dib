# Contributing to MUAD'DIB

Thanks for your interest in improving MUAD'DIB!

## Ways to contribute

### 1. Add new IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)

Edit `iocs/packages.yaml` and add:
```yaml
- id: MALWARE-XXX-001
  name: "malicious-package-name"
  version: "*"
  severity: critical
  confidence: high
  source: your-name
  description: "Short description of the threat"
  references:
    - https://link-to-blog-or-advisory
  mitre: T1195.002
```

**Severity levels:** critical, high, medium, low

**MITRE techniques:**
- T1195.002 — Supply chain compromise
- T1552.001 — Credentials in files
- T1059 — Command execution
- T1027 — Obfuscation
- T1041 — Exfiltration

### 2. Add detection rules

Edit `src/rules/index.js` and add a new rule:
```javascript
my_new_rule: {
  id: 'MUADDIB-XXX-001',
  name: 'My New Detection',
  severity: 'HIGH',
  confidence: 'high',
  description: 'What this rule detects',
  references: ['https://...'],
  mitre: 'T1195.002'
}
```

### 3. Add response playbooks

Edit `src/response/playbooks.js` and add:
```javascript
case 'my_new_rule':
  return 'Step-by-step response instructions';
```

### 4. Report false positives

Open an issue with:
- Package name
- Detection rule triggered
- Why it's a false positive

### 5. Report missed detections

Open an issue with:
- Malicious package name
- What it does
