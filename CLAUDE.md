# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm test          # Run all tests (custom framework, ~316 tests)
npm run lint      # ESLint with security plugin
npm run scan      # Self-scan: node bin/muaddib.js scan .
npm run update    # Download latest IOCs
```

Scan a specific scanner's test fixtures:
```bash
node bin/muaddib.js scan tests/samples/ast --explain
node bin/muaddib.js scan tests/samples/entropy
```

Tests use a custom framework in `tests/run-tests.js` (no Jest). Test helpers:
- `test(name, fn)` / `asyncTest(name, fn)` — sync/async test registration
- `runScan(target, options)` — executes CLI and captures stdout
- `assert(cond, msg)` / `assertIncludes(str, substr, msg)`

**Important:** `execSync` throws on non-zero exit codes. When scanning test fixtures that contain threats, wrap in try/catch and read `e.stdout`.

## Architecture

**CLI entry:** `bin/muaddib.js` — yargs-based dispatcher, delegates to `src/index.js`.

**Core orchestration:** `src/index.js` — `run(targetPath, options)` launches 12 scanners in parallel via `Promise.all`, then deduplicates, scores (0-100 weighted: CRITICAL=25, HIGH=10, MEDIUM=3, LOW=1), enriches with rules/playbooks, and outputs (CLI/JSON/HTML/SARIF).

**Scanner pattern:** Each of the 12 scanners in `src/scanner/` returns `Array<{type, severity, message, file}>`:
- `file` must use `path.relative(targetPath, absolutePath)` for Windows compatibility
- Sync scanners are wrapped in `Promise.resolve()` in the Promise.all
- Use `findFiles(dir, { extensions, excludedDirs })` from `src/utils.js` for file walking
- Size guard: skip files > 10MB via `fs.statSync`

**PyPI support:** `src/scanner/python.js` detects Python projects by scanning `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, and `pyproject.toml`. Dependencies are matched against PyPI IOCs (14K+ from OSV dump) and checked for typosquatting via Levenshtein distance with PEP 503 normalization.

**Other key features (not scanners):**
- `src/sandbox.js` — Docker-based dynamic analysis: installs a package in an isolated container, captures filesystem changes, network traffic (tcpdump), and process spawns (strace)
- `src/diff.js` — Compares scan results between two git refs to surface only new threats (useful in CI)

**Rules & playbooks:** Threat types map to rules in `src/rules/index.js` (MITRE ATT&CK mapped) and remediation text in `src/response/playbooks.js`. Both keyed by threat `type` string.

**IOC system (3-tier):**
1. `src/ioc/data/iocs-compact.json` (~5MB, ships with npm) — wildcards[] + versioned{} Maps for O(1) lookup
2. YAML files in `iocs/` — builtin rules
3. External sources (downloaded by `muaddib update`) — Shai-Hulud, DataDog, OSV dump

`loadCachedIOCs()` from `src/ioc/updater.js` merges all tiers and returns optimized Maps/Sets.

## Adding a New Scanner

1. Create `src/scanner/my-scanner.js` exporting a function that takes `targetPath` and returns threats array
2. Import in `src/index.js`, add to the Promise.all destructuring and the threats spread
3. Add rule entry in `src/rules/index.js` with id, name, severity, confidence, description, mitre
4. Add playbook entry in `src/response/playbooks.js`
5. Add tests in `tests/run-tests.js` (new section before `// RESULTS`)
6. Create test fixtures in `tests/samples/my-scanner/`

## Key Constraints

- **No external runtime deps** beyond what's in package.json (acorn, chalk, yargs, js-yaml, adm-zip, @inquirer/prompts)
- **Windows paths:** Always use `path.relative()` for file references in threats; never shell `!` in scripts
- **Symlink protection:** `findFiles` uses `lstatSync` + inode tracking (maxDepth fallback on Windows where ino=0)
- **Python typosquat false positives:** Typosquat check must skip packages that ARE in the popular list to avoid false positives (flask↔black)
- **Compact IOC format:** 87% of packages are wildcards (all versions malicious); `iocs.json` (112MB) is gitignored, `iocs-compact.json` (~5MB) is committed

## Post-Release Documentation Checklist
After every version bump / npm publish, update these files:
- README.md: scanner count, test count, version number, feature list, badges
- SECURITY.md: scanner/rule ID list, severity levels, any added/removed rules
- CHANGELOG.md: new version entry with all changes
- package.json version must match npm published version
Never skip documentation updates when publishing a new version.

## Git Workflow

- Always create a branch: `git checkout -b type/name` (e.g. `feat/entropy-scanner`, `fix/false-positive`)
- Open a PR and wait for CI to pass before merging
- Never commit directly to master
- Do not create commits automatically — the user handles commits manually
